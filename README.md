## Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where each player takes turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or an "O". The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

This project provides a web-based version of the game that you can play in your browser.
